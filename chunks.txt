Speech of 
Nirmala Sitharaman 
Minister of Finance 
February 1, 2026 
 
Hon’ble Speaker, 
On the sacred occasion of Magha Purnima and the birth 
anniversary of Guru Ravidas, I present the Budget for the year 2026-2027. 
Introduction  
1. Since we assumed office 12 years ago, India’s economic trajectory 
has been marked by stability, fiscal discipline, sustained growth and 
moderate inflation. This is the result of conscious choices we have made, 
even in times of heightened uncertainty and di sruption. Our 
Government, led by Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi, has decisively and

Government, led by Hon’ble Prime Minister Modi, has decisively and 
consistently chosen action over ambivalence, reform over rhetoric and 
people over populism.  
2. We have pursued far reaching structural reforms,  
fiscal prudence and monetary stability whilst  
maintaining a strong thrust on public investment.   
Keeping atmanirbharta as a lodestar, we have built domestic 
manufacturing capacity, energy security and reduced critical import 
dependencies.  Simultaneously, we have ensured that citizens benefit 
from every action of the Government, undertaking reforms to support

employment generation, agricultural productivity, household purchasing 
power and universal services to people.  
These measures have delivered a high growth rate of around 7% and 
helped us make substantial strides in poverty reduction and 
improvement in the lives of our people.  
3. Today, we face an external environment in which trade and 
multilateralism are imperilled and access to resources and supply chains 
are disrupted. New technologies are transforming production systems 
while sharply increasing demands on water, energy and critical minerals.

while sharply increasing demands on water, energy and critical minerals.  
4. India will continue to take confident steps towards Viksit Bharat, 
balancing ambition with inclusion. As a growing economy with expanding 
trade and capital needs, India must also remain deeply integrated with 
global markets, exporting more and attracting s table long -term 
investment. 
 
Part A 
5. As I begin Part A, I want to express my gratitude to the people for 
standing firmly with us as we forge our way together towards becoming 
one of the largest economies of the world.

one of the largest economies of the world. 
6. Our aim is to transform aspiration into achievement and potential 
into performance, as we ensure that the dividends of growth reach every 
farmer, the scheduled caste, the scheduled tribes, the nomads, the youth, 
the poor and the women. 
7. In the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2026, several 
innovative ideas were shared with our Prime Minister, which have 
inspired many of the proposals, making this a unique Yuva Shakti-driven 
Budget.  
8. Our Government’s ‘Sankalp’ is to focus on our poor,

8. Our Government’s ‘Sankalp’ is to focus on our poor, 
underprivileged and the disadvantaged . To deliver on this Sankalp, and 
given that this is the first Budget prepared in Kartavya Bhawan, we are 
inspired by 3 kartavya:  
9. Our first kartavya is to accelerate and sustain economic growth, 
by enhancing productivity and competitiveness, and building resilience to 
volatile global dynamics.

10. Our second kartavya is to fulfil aspirations of our people and build 
their capacity, making them strong partners in India’s path to prosperity. 
11. Our third kartavya, aligned with our vision of Sabka Sath, Sabka 
Vikas, is to ensure that every family, community, region and sector has 
access to resources, amenities and opportunities for meaningful 
participation.   
12. This threefold approach requires a supportive ecosystem. The first 
requirement is to sustain the momentum of structural reforms — 
continuous, adaptive, and forward -looking. Second, a robust and

continuous, adaptive, and forward -looking. Second, a robust and 
resilient financial sector is central to mobilising savings, allocating capital 
efficiently and managing risks. Third, cutting-edge technologies, 
including AI applications,  can serve as force multipliers for better 
governance.  
Reform Express 
13. Our Government has undertaken comprehensive economic 
reforms towards creating employment, boosting productivity and 
accelerating growth. After the Prime Minister’s announcement on 
Independence Day in 2025, over 350 reforms have been rolled out. These
